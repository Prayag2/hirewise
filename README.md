# Project Description
Task: Task is to create a home page for a recruitment startup. This portal will be used by companies in India and worldwide for Hiring software engineers, Product Managers, Data Scientist etc. Please have a look at the 2-3 features from reference websites and develop it for the demo purpose. You have to make one page (home screen) for the frontend.

# My Plan
## Names
I generated a few names for the website using ChatGPT and decided to choose "HireWise".
1.  HireWise (Final)
2.  HireGuru
3.  SkillGenie
4.  TalentMagnet

## Logo
I used Bing AI to generate a simple logo for the website and later recreated it in Inkscape.

## Webpage Structure
I then used ChatGPT to provide me sample data to put on the homepage-

### Home
1.  Header
    -   Logo
    -   Navbar

2.  Hero section
    -   Heading: "Discover Your Path to Success"
    -   Subheading: "Unlock Your Potential With Our Premiere Recruitment Solutions"
    -   Button: "Explore Opportunities"
    -   Illustration I used [undraw.co](https://undraw.co) to get an open source illustration for the website which has matching colours from the logo.
