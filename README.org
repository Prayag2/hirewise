* Project Description
Task: Task is to create a home page for a recruitment startup. This portal will be used by companies in India and worldwide for Hiring software engineers, Product Managers, Data Scientist etc. Please have a look at the 2-3 features from reference websites and develop it for the demo purpose. You have to make one page (home screen) for the frontend.
* My Plan
** Names
I generated a few names for the website using ChatGPT and decided to choose "HireWise".
1. HireWise (Final)
2. HireGuru
3. SkillGenie
4. TalentMagnet
** Logo
I used Bing AI to generate a simple logo for the website and later recreated it in Inkscape.
*** AI Generated Logo

*** Final Logo (recreated in Inkscape)

** Webpage Structure
I then used ChatGPT to provide me sample data to put on the homepage-
*** Home
**** Header
- Logo
- Navbar
**** Hero section
- Heading: "Discover Your Path to Success"
- Subheading: "Unlock Your Potential With Our Premiere Recruitment Solutions"
- Button: "Explore Opportunities"
- Illustration
  I used [[https://undraw.co][undraw.co]] to get an open source illustration for the website which has matching colours from the logo.

I created several wireframes on my notepad for all the sections of the page.

These are the CSS variables that I will use-
#+begin_src css
